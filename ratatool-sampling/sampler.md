Sampler
=======

Diffy contains record sampling classes for Avro, BigQuery, Parquet. Supported filesystems include Local, GCS (`gs://`), and HDFS (`hdfs://`).

# BigSampler

BigSampler will run a [Scio](https://github.com/spotify/scio) pipeline sampling either Avro or BigQuery data.
 It also allows specifying a seed and fields to hash for deterministic cohort selection.

For full details see [BigSample.scala](https://github.com/spotify/ratatool/blob/master/ratatool-sampling/src/main/scala/com/spotify/ratatool/samplers/BigSampler.scala)
